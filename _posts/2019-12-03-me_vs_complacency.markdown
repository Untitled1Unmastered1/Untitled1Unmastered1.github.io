“Complacency is a state of mind that exists only in retrospective: it has to be shattered before being ascertained.”
Vladimir Nabokov 


          Fear and laziness. The two things that have always plagued me from achieving my full potential. Five years into banking, I’ve succeeded and moved up way past other peers who have degrees and years of experience over me. You would think this sort of success would bring satisfaction and passion to your everyday work life  , but it doesn’t. Once you plateau and stop feeling challenged, you become complacent. And day by day, you become more and more miserable and you get locked into this lifestyle which you have no idea how you got into to begin with. 

            Ever since I was a kid, my heart yearned for adventure. I was obsessed with the outdoors.  As I grew up and was struck by the stark reality of life, I realized that if I wanted true adventure I would have to fight for an uncommon sort of lifestyle. As an adult my true passion is backpacking and traveling. Unfortunately, I’m limited to traveling only about three to four times a year. However, a friend had pitched to me an idea about becoming a digital nomad. I thought it sounded preposterous and far fetched, how could I be on the road and work at the same time? That night I began to research what sort of jobs would get me the ultimate lifestyle that I would do anything to achieve, and he was right. There was a multitude of software developers who were these so-called “digital nomads”. 

       Fear began to kick in, was I fantasizing over something I could never attain? Am I smart enough or driven enough to ever achieve such a lofty goal ? But regardless of my self doubt , I couldn’t stop obsessing over this lifestyle and reading blogs of other digital nomads. Eventually, I began downloading apps like SoloLearn, Grasshopper, and Encode. I was surprised by how fascinating this all was and how involved I became in such a short span of time. I knew I had barely touched the tip of the iceberg with coding but I was convinced that this was something that could truly challenge me, and I kept revisiting these applications day after day. A friend of mine who had already begun with FlatIron, showed me how flexible the curriculum was even for people who worked a full time job, and after careful consideration I was sold. 

          The journey has been a bit rough at moments, juggling between a full time job as a Bank Supervisor, being married, coding and trying to maintain a social life can be cumbersome and seem like a daunting task. But after every difficult lab I pass and the countless hours I spend  studying, I see myself becoming passionate about something again. Will I ever become a Digital Nomad? Who knows. But for once I feel challenged. And as difficult as it’s been to toggle a full time job and the curriculum, for the first time in years I feel truly driven, no matter the odds.
