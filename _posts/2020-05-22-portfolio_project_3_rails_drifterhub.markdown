Rails is absolute magic. I've had the most fun in this entire curriculum with the Rails portion. I can't wait to jump into Javascript so I can finally make a Full Stack application, using Rails as the Back-End. But anywho, let's talk about the application at hand. 


DrifterHub is essentially a way for backpackers to not only post their amazing experiences in the wild, but also to be able to give their input on others' experiences. A user, or drifter, can create a post or journey, if you will, which lets them give details about their past journeys. They can speak about the mileage, the location, the date, how it made them feel and give full blown details about what crazy things happened during the expedition. They can also delete their accounts as well as their posts. 

I would say one of my favorite parts of this whole assessment was using the OmniAuth gem, and the fact that a user can sign in from a third party account. More updates to this app in the future!
