  Hey there Historians(or not)!
	
 For my CLI project I scraped information from a website that lists the 14 most decisive ancient battles in history. I severely underestimated this project.. and unfortunately due to the holiday season & moving out of my place got caught  really behind. Regardless, It's a simple concept .. a list is displayed of the battles, showing the year it took place in and as well as the parties involved and the location. Once you type the number of the battle you'd like information about, it gives you a summary of the battle as well as the victorious party. You also get a nice shakespearan quip if you type in a number not available or a typo.
	
As simple as it sounds, it took me quite some time and help from other fellow students to really get a grasp on how to properly scrape. Setting up my environment(Windows 10 subsytem for Linux) was a true pain in the butt. I can't recall the last time I googled so much. I first started the CLI with fake data(based off Avi's Daily Deals vid), and built it up from there. Unfortunately,  the website I ended up choosing out of all the candidates was a mess.. and led to less than ideal code. I had to ask for help a multitude of times. However,  I had a blast doing this. Labs are great, but when you're out there on your own and creating something from scratch it really builds you. Binding.pry was my best friend, and the feeling you get after prying for way too long(really almost pulled my hair out), and finally suceeding is ethereal. I am proud of my simple project. 
	 
My resolution is to really try my best to spend as much time coding as possible and not underestimate anything thrown my way. I'm super stoked to see what more complex programs we have to create further along, and my resolve is stronger. This project really taught me the importance of time management.  I vow to be much more ambitious with my next project. But regardless this was a terrific experience that I'm grateful for.
